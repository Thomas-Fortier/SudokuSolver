# Sudoku
The program will solve a Sudoku board with initial values

# Description
This was an experimental project to create an algorithm that
can solve a Sudoku board. The type of algorithm.

The backtracking algorithm does exactly what it sounds like.
In the case of Sudoku, if at a given point it cannot fill in a cell,
it will backtrack to a previous cell and change its value until it
finds a valid solution.

# Notes
Currently, you have to hard code the initial values of the board.
I plan on potentially changing this. If you want to add your own board,
you can change the values in Board.cs.

There is a graphical version in progress. It will be released ASAP.
